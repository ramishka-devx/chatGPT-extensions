- **Customizable UI**: The display is styled with a simple, user-friendly interface that can be customized to fit different screen sizes or user preferences.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For structuring the content and sidebar layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the sidebar and headings.
- **JavaScript**: For extracting chat headings, observing DOM changes, and dynamically updating the sidebar.
